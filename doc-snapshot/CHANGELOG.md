# Doc drift changelog

What the CopilotKit docs changed under this repo, written by whichever sync
ran — the `/doc-sync` page or `npm run drift:sync`. Only pages that actually
moved are recorded — a sync that finds everything unchanged writes nothing
here at all.

Holds the 3 most recent dated entries. When a change lands on a fourth
date, the oldest entry is dropped. Entries are counted, not aged, so a gap of
weeks between changes does not expire anything.

- ## What is a memory?
- A memory is a short, durable statement about a user or a project, stored outside
- any single thread. "Prefers concise status updates" is a memory. The forty
- messages that revealed the preference are a thread.
+ ## Start with your coding agent
+ Copy this prompt into your coding agent to inspect your existing CopilotKit app and configure long-term memory for your users. Prefer to work through the setup yourself? Follow the manual steps below.

- ## How Automatic Learning works
- Learning starts with a container, which groups Threads from the same kind of work. Intelligence analyzes completed runs in that container and summarizes recurring patterns as Insights.
- When a pattern can be reused, Learning proposes a Skill. You review the supporting Threads and decide whether to publish it. A published Skill is a versioned set of instructions that you load into your agent; Learning does not change the model itself.
- Automatic Learning checks eligible containers on a daily schedule. After you approve a skill, [skill delivery](/ms-agent-python/intelligence/learned-skills) makes it available to connected agents. A scheduled run does not approve skills. Turning on delivery does not connect your agent for you.
+ ## Start with your coding agent
+ Copy this prompt into your coding agent to inspect your existing app and configure Automatic Learning for one focused workflow. Prefer to work through the setup yourself? Follow the manual steps below.
