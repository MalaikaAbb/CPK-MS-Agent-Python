# Autorecorder

Automated screen-recording suite for CopilotKit framework integrations. It
produces one narrated-looking demo video per documentation page: read the doc,
switch to VS Code and show the code that implements it, switch to the browser and
drive the live feature.

Currently configured for **Microsoft Agent Framework (Python) + React**.

> **Porting this to another framework?** Read **[ADAPT.md](ADAPT.md)** first. It
> is written for the person or agent doing the port, and it is the contract the
> `doctor` command enforces.

## Run it

Both services must be up first — the recorder refuses to start otherwise, because
a video of a dead page is worse than no video.

```bash
cd backend  && uv run --prerelease=allow main.py     # :8020
cd frontend && npm run dev                           # :3020
```

Then:

```bash
cd autorecorder
npm install
npx playwright install chromium

npm run doctor            # is the configuration sane?
npm run record -- --list  # what will be recorded
npm run record -- --quickstart
npm run record            # all pages, in order
```

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--list`, `-l` | Print every registered route and exit |
| `--help`, `-h` | Print the flags and exit |
| `--doctor` | Validate the configuration; exits 1 on error |
| `--doctor --online` | Also probe every doc/demo URL and the selectors |
| `--<page-id>` | Record one page — `--quickstart`, `--slots` |
| `--page=<id>` | Same thing, explicit form |
| `--pages=<id,id>` | Exactly these pages (`--only=` is an alias) |
| `--filter=<query>` | Record every page whose id or name contains the query |
| `--limit=<n>` | First *n* of the selection (`--first=`, `--count=`) |
| `--force` | Record even if the pre-flight health check fails |

Every run also writes `videos/RECORD_RESULTS.json` — one entry per page with
pass/fail, the notes, the browser console errors and the file it wrote. Read
results from that file, not from whatever `.webm` files happen to be in the
folder.

```bash
npm run check             # typecheck + unit tests + core/ drift check
npm test                  # just the unit tests (screen parsing, cast pacing, page selection)
npm run core:check        # core/ still matches core/CORE_MANIFEST.json
```

For the scaffolding CLI itself — a separate pipeline, no services needed — see
[Recording the CLI](#recording-the-cli).

Videos land in `videos/` as `<videoPrefix>-<NN>-<name>.webm`, 1920×1080, ~25fps
(Playwright's capture rate; it is not configurable).

**`videos/` is gitignored on purpose.** Recordings are build output — reproducible
from this folder plus `npm run record` — and committing them is expensive: 17 clips
at ~5MB, rewritten on every re-record, took one repo's `.git` to 348MB before its
history had to be rewritten. Publish them as release assets or to a bucket. Keep
this policy when you copy the folder into another repo.

## Reading the summary

```
   ✅ [PASS]  (24.1s) Quickstart -> MSPY-react-01-Quickstart.webm
   ⚠️  [PASS*] (31.7s) Inspector -> MSPY-react-06-Inspector.webm
        · Doc page (…/inspector): Timeout 25000ms exceeded
   ⚠️  [PASS*] (28.0s) Generative UI - Tool Rendering -> MSPY-react-09-ToolRendering.webm
        · [Tool Rendering] "Called the weather API for" never appeared. The reply streamed, but the useRenderTool component did not mount
   ❌ [FAIL]  (19.4s) AG-UI -> MSPY-react-17-AgUi.webm
        · Demo step failed: Agent never produced a response within 30s
```

- **PASS** — every step completed and everything the handler checked for was
  on screen.
- **PASS\*** — recorded, with a note. Either the external doc page misbehaved
  (intro footage degraded, feature not implicated) or the handler did not see
  something the doc promises — a renderer that never mounted, a state panel
  that stayed empty, a browser console error. The video is still the evidence;
  the note says what to look for in it.
- **FAIL** — the demo route 404'd, never rendered a chat surface, the agent never
  answered, the IDE view could not be built, or the handler called `ctx.fail`
  (an approval card that never appeared, a button that was not there to click).
  The clip is still saved. The process exits 1, so a script can gate on it.

Handlers report through `ctx.warn` / `ctx.fail` (see `actions/index.ts`). A
`console.log` in a handler reaches the terminal and nothing else.

---

## When a take fails

A failed take no longer ends on the broken page. Before the browser closes,
the recorder opens the simulated terminal and prints what it saw: the
diagnosed verdict, the browser console errors, and this page's slice of
`videos/logs/backend.log` and `frontend.log` (from where they stood when the
take began). Each section is windowed around the line most worth reading --
a traceback, an `Error`, a 4xx/5xx -- and that line is painted red, so the
clip itself shows the cause. The same text is written to
`videos/logs/<page-id>.error.log`, so an agent can diagnose from the log
without re-running anything.

Passing takes are untouched: the terminal appears only on failure, which is
what a person who hit an error would do. `core/failure-evidence.ts` holds
the logic; the engine calls it from the `finally` of `recordPage`.

## Layout

The split between what you edit and what you don't is the point of this folder.

Every framework-specific value lives in `config/`. If something in `core/` needs
to change for a port, that is a bug in this folder — see ADAPT.md.

That rule is checked, not just stated: `core/CORE_MANIFEST.json` holds a hash
of every core file and `npm run core:check` fails when they differ. A
deliberate core change is followed by `npm run core:write`, and the manifest
diff is the list of what to port to the other repos. To see how two copies
differ: `node scripts/core-manifest.mjs --diff ../../Other-repo/autorecorder`.

## What a recording actually does

1. **Doc page** — opens the real documentation URL, waits for hydration, then
   scrolls at reading pace and rests the cursor on a code block. Clicks VS Code
   on the simulated taskbar.
2. **IDE** — renders the project's own source, read from disk and highlighted
   with Shiki, with the page's line range selected. Multi-tab pages switch tabs.
   Served from the frontend's origin via an intercepted route, so the doc page is
   fully unloaded rather than painted over. Clicks Chrome on the taskbar.
3. **Demo** — opens the chrome-free demo route, types the prompt, waits for the
   reply to finish streaming, and pauses for reading.

### What makes it read as a person

Every pace in a take comes from `core/overlays/human.ts`, seeded from the
page id. So the Quickstart clip and the Slots clip do not type, pause and
scroll in the same rhythm — but tonight's Quickstart clip is identical to
last night's, which keeps two recordings of the same page comparable.

- **Typing** has a person's rhythm everywhere it happens: the chat prompt, the
  Notepad note, and the command typed at the terminal prompt before its output
  starts. Jittered keystrokes, a beat after punctuation, the odd pause.
- **Scrolling** is in bursts: a few wheel notches, a reading pause, a few more,
  sometimes a nudge back up.
- **Pauses** vary by about a quarter around their nominal length. They are
  the only thing `AUTORECORD_PACE` scales (e.g. `0.85`): a reading or
  thinking pause gets shorter, the typing, the mouse and the scrolling do not.
- **The cursor** overshoots slightly on long travel and settles, hovers a
  variable moment before a click, drifts while a reply streams instead of
  freezing, and starts each take somewhere plausible rather than dead centre.
- **Windows** fade in over 180ms (IDE, terminal, Notepad) instead of cutting.

Two details worth knowing, because both were bugs once:

- Overlays are injected as children of `<html>`, which React owns on any App
  Router page. `ensureOverlays` installs a MutationObserver that re-attaches them
  if a render pass deletes them, and step 1 waits for hydration before scrolling
  so a remount cannot snap the page back to the top.
- Native `window.alert` dialogs are browser chrome, so video capture never sees
  them (and Playwright auto-dismisses them). The Frontend Tools page needs its
  alert visible to prove the handler ran in the browser, so its action installs
  a DOM replica of Chrome's dialog via `core/overlays/alert-dialog.ts` and
  clicks OK with the virtual cursor. Opt-in — no other page is affected.

- The Readables take ends with a simulated Windows 11 Notepad window
  (`core/overlays/notepad.ts`), opened from the taskbar and typed into
  character-by-character at human rhythm, holding the issue report for that
  page. Also opt-in per action.

- Playwright starts recording when the page is created, so the first navigation
  is dead footage. The doc URL is warmed in a throwaway page first, which cuts
  it roughly in half; removing the rest would need an ffmpeg trim in post.

- Before the first take, every demo route in the selection is fetched at once
  (`core/prewarm.ts`) so the dev server's first compile happens off camera. One
  Chromium serves the whole run, with a fresh context per take, so the clips are
  unchanged and the five-second launch is paid once. And a take whose console
  already says the agent run failed stops waiting for a reply immediately
  instead of sitting out the full window.

## Recording the CLI

The scaffolding CLI is interactive — menus, arrow keys, a prompt that acts on a
single keystroke — so it cannot be driven by piping text at it. It runs under a
real pseudo-terminal (`node-pty`), and the session is replayed in a terminal
window for the camera.

### The videos

One clip of the CLI, then three per package manager, so one manager's set
tells its whole story without cross-referencing another:

| # | File | Shows |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `<prefix>-CLI-Create.webm` | the doc page, then `npx copilotkit@latest create` answering every prompt. One clip, shared: the CLI ran once and the result was copied into all four folders |
| 2 | `<prefix>-<pm>-2-Install.webm` | that manager running `install` in its own folder — **always filmed, pass or fail**, so the install command itself can be checked |
| 3a | `<prefix>-<pm>-3-Demo.webm` | if the install **worked**: the doc page, VS Code with `package.json` + that manager's lockfile + the integration code, `<pm> run dev` booting, then the real app answering a prompt |
| 3b | `<prefix>-<pm>-3-Finding.webm` | if the install **failed**: the doc page, VS Code with the resolved versions and the manifest, the install failing in the terminal, then a Notepad note explaining it |

Which third clip a manager gets is decided by its install report, not by
hand. `npm run cli:videos` reads `casts/<pm>.report.json`: a failed install
gets the finding clip; a working one gets its demo recorded. The finding note
is built from the report (command, exit code, the last lines on screen) so a
failure nobody has looked at yet still produces a clip that names the error;
the hand-written analysis in `INSTALL_ANALYSIS` (`config/cli.config.ts`) is
appended underneath when there is one.

Video 3a is a recording of the running app, not a re-enactment: the dev server
filmed booting in the terminal is the same process that serves the page driven
in the next segment, and the reply on screen is a live agent round trip.

### The pipeline

```bash
npm run check                       # 1. typecheck, unit tests, core/ manifest

npm run capture -- --login          # 2. once — sign-in opens a browser; also
                                    #    proves the PTY works on this machine
npm run capture -- --scaffold       # 3. run the real CLI, once
npm run capture -- --distribute     # 4. copy it ×4, seed the model key

npm run capture -- --install-npm    # 5. install per manager; each one also
npm run capture -- --install-pnpm   #    writes that copy's VERSIONS.md
npm run capture -- --install-yarn
npm run capture -- --install-bun

npm run cli:videos                  # 6. ► every clip: CLI, four installs, and
                                    #    per manager the finding or the demo
```

`npm run render -- --list` shows, per manager, which third clip it will get.
`npm run render -- --all` films without recording the demos, and prints the
`record` command for the ones that succeeded.

**Capture and render are separate commands, and that split is the point.**

A CLI run scaffolds directories, installs packages, and may block on browser
sign-in — minutes of real, side-effecting work. Rendering is offline and takes
seconds. Keeping them apart means fixing a font size, a pace, or a doc page that
changed never re-runs `npm install` or asks anyone to sign in again. The cast is
also the QA artifact: it is text, so a CLI that changes its prompts under
`@latest` shows up as a diff instead of a mysteriously broken driver.

### How a flow answers prompts

`config/cli.config.ts` describes prompts, not keystrokes:

```ts
{
  label: 'Agent framework',
  waitFor: /Select agent framework/i,
  select: { label: 'Microsoft Agent Framework (Python)', max: 40 },
  keys: ['Enter'],
}
```

`select` walks the list until the highlighted row matches the label. It is never
"press Down twelve times" — the framework list holds 23 entries today and grows
with every integration CopilotKit ships, so a hardcoded count silently scaffolds
the wrong framework the day an entry is inserted above the target, and reports
success while doing it. `npm run doctor` rejects a step that sends more than one
arrow key without a `select`.

Three more things the driver gets right, each of which was a real failure mode:

- **Every action waits for its prompt**, never for a timer. An npx cache miss or
  a sign-in round trip moves a prompt by minutes.
- **The screen is read from the end of the stream.** A TUI repaints over itself,
  so the accumulated bytes contain every historical frame; matching the whole
  buffer answers questions about a screen that is no longer there.
- **`Enter` is sent only where a prompt wants it.** The dependency prompt acts on
  a single keypress; an extra `Enter` there leaks into the next prompt and
  answers it before it has painted.

Conditional prompts are marked `optional: true` and skipped when absent — npx
only offers to install an uncached package, and only 18 of the 23 frameworks'
starters offer a chat channel at all.

### One scaffold, four package managers

The CLI runs **once**. `--distribute` copies the result into `1-cli-testing/npm`,
`pnpm`, `yarn` and `bun`, excluding `node_modules`, and seeds the repo root
`.env` into each copy's `.env` and `agent/.env`. (The old `install-all.ps1`
seeded from `1-cli-testing/.env`, which holds no key at all.)

Running the CLI four times instead would make the *scaffold* a variable in a test
whose only subject is the install, so a difference between managers could not be
attributed to the manager. Seeding the key once, before the copy, is likewise
the difference between one placement and four chances to typo it — and it keeps
the key out of every recording, since the scaffold is created without one.

`--distribute` refuses to overwrite a directory that already exists unless given
`--force`. Those directories hold installed trees that are not in version
control, so replacing one is not a recoverable mistake.

### The demo recordings

`demo-npm`, `demo-pnpm`, `demo-yarn` and `demo-bun` are ordinary page recordings
with one addition: each declares a `devServer`. The engine then boots that
server before filming, replays its boot in a terminal between the IDE and the
demo, points the demo at its origin, and kills it afterwards — so the terminal
segment is genuinely the process serving the app in the next segment.

The IDE segment shows `package.json` and then that manager's own lockfile. The
manifest declares *ranges*, so on its own it cannot answer "which versions is
this?" — and the lockfile is where the answer is written down, per manager,
which is the one place four package managers can visibly differ. (`VERSIONS.md`,
the generated summary of the same thing, stays on the install and finding clips;
showing both here would say it twice before the app has appeared.)

Each runs on its own port (3021–3024), never 3000 or 3020. The repo's own frontend
holds 3020 (and other apps hold 3000), and a demo that quietly recorded against *that* would look
like a pass while proving nothing about the scaffold.

Not 3101–3104 either, and that is not superstition. This suite is copied into
every framework repo, so every copy of `pages.config.ts` started from the same
port range — and a sibling repo's scaffold left running on 3101 was enough for
`npm run dev` here to die with `EADDRINUSE` while the browser cheerfully filmed
*that other framework's app*, which of course never answered. Give each
framework repo its own range.

### Video 3, per manager

| Manager | Install | Video 3 | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| npm | ✅ | ✅ recorded | full round trip: dev server boots, agent replies |
| pnpm | ✅ after `--approve-pnpm` | ✅ recorded | pnpm 10 refuses untrusted build scripts and exits 1; `pnpm approve-builds --all` is captured as its own flow, then the install is re-run |
| yarn | ✅ | ✅ recorded | the cold turbopack compile used to overrun the demo navigation; `startService` now warms `originUrl + demoPath` inside the boot window, so the browser opens a page that is already compiled |
| bun | ❌ | finding clip | the Windows postinstall finding (`CLI_FINDING_VIDEOS`) |

Three things `startService` now does that it once did not, each of which had
produced a wrong-looking pass:

- **Warms the demo route** once `readyPattern` matches, so a route that
  compiles on first request compiles during the boot footage (240s budget)
  rather than inside the demo navigation (`demoNavMs`, 45s by default).
- **Checks the port is free** before spawning. A sibling repo's dev server on
  the same port used to become the subject of the recording while the real
  server died quietly.
- **Aborts on failure text** — `EADDRINUSE`, `address already in use`,
  `Cannot find module` — instead of matching `readyPattern` against a stream
  that contains both the error and enough noise to look ready. Override per
  page with `devServer.abortOn`.

The waits themselves are configuration now: `PROJECT.timeouts` in
`project.config.ts` for the project, `timeouts` on a page entry to override,
defaults in `core/timeouts.ts`.

The demo pages are marked `generated: true`, meaning their files exist only
after the pipeline has run. Before that the doctor reports them as warnings
rather than errors, and an unfiltered `npm run record` skips them with a note
saying how to produce them. Naming one explicitly still records it, and still
fails — which is the right answer to "record this specific thing that is
missing".

### Run it at your own machine

The CLI pipeline is meant to be run by a person at a real terminal. Four
reasons, not one:

- **Sign-in is interactive.** Linking the app to an Intelligence project opens a
  browser and finishes back at the terminal. The CLI refuses to run in a shell
  with no terminal rather than opening a browser it cannot finish with.
- **They are side-effecting** — scaffolding writes directories, and the installs
  fetch four dependency trees.
- **They spend a real account** — a hosted Intelligence project, and a real model
  key for the demos.
- **The failure would be misread.** A run that timed out waiting for a browser
  sign-in looks exactly like a broken CLI, which is the opposite of what this
  suite exists to report.

Run `--login` once up front and everything after it is deterministic.

### What is not automated, deliberately

The model API key is never typed into the CLI and never appears in a recording —
the scaffold is created without one and the key is placed into the project
afterwards.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`Aborting before launching a browser`** — a service is down. The message names
which one and the command to start it. `--force` overrides.

**A page fails with "Agent never produced a response within 30s"** — either the
demo is genuinely broken, or `selectors.config.ts → assistantMessage` does not
match this app's messages. Run `npm run doctor --online` to tell the two apart:
it now prints which alternative of each selector actually matched, and warns
when `assistantMessage` matches something before any reply exists. For an
agent that is slow rather than broken, raise `replyStartMs` on that page.

**A page passes with `PASS*` and a note from the handler** — the reply came,
but the thing the doc promises did not: read the note, then watch the clip at
that moment. Those notes are also in `videos/RECORD_RESULTS.json`.

**"Port 3021 is already in use"** — another dev server holds the port, usually
a sibling repo's scaffold left running. Stop it; the recorder refuses rather
than filming the wrong app.

**The IDE highlights the wrong lines** — the line range drifted. `npm run doctor`
names the file and where its markers actually are now.

**A recording passes but the video is wrong** — the doctor cannot see cursor
placement or highlight correctness. Watch it.
