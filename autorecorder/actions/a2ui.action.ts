/**
 * Fixed Schema A2UI — the surface, not the sentence.
 *
 * The failure this handler exists to catch is the quiet one. A2UI can fall over
 * in three ways that all leave a chat turn on screen and would all pass a
 * standard take:
 *
 *   1. the tool is never called and the agent describes a flight in prose;
 *   2. the middleware is not enabled for this agent, so `a2ui_operations` is
 *      printed into the message as raw JSON;
 *   3. the surface paints with a catalog the browser does not know, which draws
 *      nothing at all — no error, no component, an empty message.
 *
 * So the card element is required. `data-testid="a2ui-flight-card"` is on this
 * repo's own renderer, which means finding it proves the whole path: the tool
 * ran, the middleware recognised the container, the catalog ids matched, and
 * the binder resolved the data model.
