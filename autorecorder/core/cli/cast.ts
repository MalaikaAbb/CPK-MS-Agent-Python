/**
 * asciinema v2 cast files — the recorder's intermediate format for terminals.
 *
 * Why an intermediate format at all, rather than filming a live terminal:
 *
 * A CLI run is the least reproducible thing this suite touches. It hits the
 * network, it may block on browser sign-in, and it takes minutes. Filming it
 * live means any cosmetic defect in the video -- wrong font size, wrong pacing,
 * a cropped window -- costs another full run to fix.
 *
 * Capturing to a cast splits those concerns. The run happens once and produces
 * a text file; the video is rendered from that file as many times as needed,
 * offline and deterministically. The same file is also the QA artifact: it is
 * diffable, so a CLI that changes its prompts under `@latest` shows up as a
 * diff rather than as a mysteriously broken driver.
 *
 * Format (https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/asciicast/v2/): a JSON header line
 * followed by one JSON array per event, `[elapsedSeconds, code, data]`, where
 * code is "o" for terminal output and "i" for input.
