/**
 * VERSIONS.md for a scaffolded app — what actually got installed.
 *
 * `package.json` declares RANGES. A demo that leads with `"^1.69.2"` while the
 * run it documents installed 1.69.3 puts the one file on screen that cannot
 * answer "which versions is this?". The lockfile does carry resolved versions,
 * but it is tens of thousands of lines with the interesting entries scattered
 * hundreds apart, so no highlight range shows them together and every
 * dependency change moves the line numbers.
 *
 * Hence a small generated file, read from the installed tree after install, so
 * the clip shows the versions the recording actually ran against.
 *
 * Deliberately standalone: `core/` may not depend on anything outside this
 * folder, or the recorder stops being portable.
