/**
 * Reading a TUI's screen out of a raw PTY byte stream.

 * interactive list rewrite the whole block over itself using cursor-movement
 * escapes. Concatenating the PTY stream therefore gives every *historical*
 * frame, not the current one, and naive matching against that buffer answers
 * questions about a screen that is no longer there. The classic symptom: a
 * driver that "confirms" the highlight is on the row it wanted while the real
 * highlight moved past it ten keypresses ago.
 *
 * The helpers here work on the tail of the stream on purpose — the last frame
 * emitted is the one currently on screen.
