 * Browser console errors, captured for the run log and the issue note.

 * This started life as a replica of Chrome's DevTools console drawn over the
 * page, so a console-only failure could be seen on video. That was the wrong
 * instrument. These recordings argue "here is a person using this app and here
 * is what happened", and a panel no human could have summoned quietly converts
 * that into a presentation -- the one thing the format cannot afford.
 *
 * The capture was always the useful half, and it is invisible: it runs in Node
 * via `page.on('console')`, never touches the page, and gives the run log and
 * the Notepad note the exact error text. A tester reads the console and writes
 * down what it said; this is the same thing, minus the theatre.
 *
 * Node-side rather than a hook injected into the page, because an injected hook
 * is wiped by the next navigation and these errors arrive after one.
