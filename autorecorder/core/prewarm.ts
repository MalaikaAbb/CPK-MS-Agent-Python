/**
 * Compiles every demo route the run is about to film, before the camera rolls.
 *
 * A dev server builds each route on its first request. That first request
 * used to happen inside the take, so every clip opened on a few seconds of a
 * compiling page -- the recorder logged it as "Waiting for Next.js compilation
 * & React hydration to settle" and the viewer saw a blank pause. Hitting all of
 * the run's routes at once here moves that cost off camera and pays it once,
 * in parallel, instead of once per page in series.
 *
 * Pages that boot their own dev server are skipped: nothing is listening yet.
 * Failures are ignored -- a route that will not compile fails properly, on
 * camera, in its own take.
