/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  ADAPT THIS FILE — 3 of 4
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * One entry per doc page, in the order the doc nav lists them.
 *
 * Entries are deliberately short. `docUrl`, `demoUrl` and the output filename
 * are derived from `project.config.ts` plus the fields below, so no entry can
 * point at the wrong framework's docs and filenames stay in nav order without
 * anyone numbering them by hand.
 *
 * Adapting means: delete the pages this framework does not document, add the
 * ones it does, and fix the line ranges. `npm run doctor` then tells you which
 * ranges no longer point at real code.
 *
 * ── The line ranges ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `startLine`/`endLine` are what the simulated IDE highlights. They are
 * hardcoded, which means they drift the moment someone edits a demo page.
 * Doctor guards this: where a file carries `[!code highlight]` or `#region`
 * markers, it checks the range still covers one and names the marker's current
 * line when it does not. Keep those markers in the frontend and the guard keeps
 * working.

/**
 * The scaffolded app, running — video 3 of each package manager's set.
 *
 * The other two are the CLI creating the project and that manager installing
 * it, both in `config/cli.config.ts`. This one is the payoff, and it is a
 * recording of the real app rather than a re-enactment: the dev server filmed
 * booting in the terminal is the same process that serves the page driven
 * immediately afterwards.
 *
 * The order on screen is how someone would actually check a fresh scaffold:
 *
 *   1. the doc page that told them to run the CLI
 *   2. `package.json` — what the starter declares
 *   3. the lockfile — what this manager actually resolved, pinned
 *   4. the app's own CopilotKit code, so the chat below has a source
 *   5. `<pm> run dev` booting, in a terminal
 *   6. the app open in a browser, asked a question, answering
 *
 * Steps 2 and 3 are the pair that matters. `package.json` carries RANGES, so on
 * its own it cannot answer "which versions is this?" — and the resolved set is
 * exactly where four package managers can differ. The lockfile is where that
 * difference is written down, which is why this tab is a different file in each
 * set. VERSIONS.md, the generated summary of the same thing, stays on the
 * install and finding clips: showing both here would say it twice before the
 * app has appeared.
 *
 * All four managers are listed, bun included, even though its install dies in
 * the postinstall script on Windows. That is deliberate: this is a test harness,
 * and the entry is what re-checks the finding on every run. When bun still
 * fails, `bun run dev` never prints its ready line, the recorder reports a dev
 * server that never started and writes no video — and bun's third deliverable
 * stays the finding clip in `cli.config.ts`. When a future bun stops failing,
 * this entry starts producing a demo without anyone having to remember to add
 * it back.
 *
 * Port 3021 and up, never 3000 or 3020: the repo's own frontend usually holds 3000, and
 * a recording that quietly used *that* would look like a pass while proving
 * nothing about the scaffold.
 *
 * Not 3101–3104 either, and that is not superstition. This CLAUDE.md ships to
 * every framework repo, so every repo's copy of this file picked the same
 * ports — and a sibling repo's scaffold left running on 3101 is enough for the
 * dev server here to fail with EADDRINUSE while the browser happily records
 * *that other framework's app* answering nothing. It happened. Each framework
 * repo should move this block to its own port range rather than share one.
 *
 * `readyPattern` is what the dev server prints when it is serving. If a future
 * starter changes that wording, the recorder waits out the timeout and reports
 * that the server never started — the right failure, since it never became
 * reachable in a way this config recognises.
