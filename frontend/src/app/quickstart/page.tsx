          The bring-your-own-agent path. Three pieces: a FastAPI server that
          exposes an Agent Framework agent over AG-UI, a runtime route that
          binds it, and a chat component. Everything else in this harness is a
          variation on these.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300">
          Worth noting how thin the binding is:{" "}
          <code>add_agent_framework_fastapi_endpoint</code> on the Python side
          and a plain <code>HttpAgent</code> on the runtime side. Agent Framework
          speaks AG-UI natively, so there is no framework-specific adapter
          package to install — unlike integrations that ship their own.

              The runtime registers three agent ids rather than the doc&apos;s
              one, and the server mounts three endpoints rather than one. That is
              the only structural departure, and it exists because the Shared
              State and State Rendering pages each define their own{" "}
              <code>state_schema</code>.

        The Quickstart&apos;s runtime sample replaced{" "}
        <code>runner: new InMemoryAgentRunner()</code> with{" "}
        <code>intelligence: new CopilotKitIntelligence(&#123; apiKey &#125;)</code>{" "}
        plus <code>identifyUser</code>, and reads{" "}
        <code>CPK_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY</code> from <code>.env</code>. As of the
        2026-09-21 sync the key is no longer pasted by hand into{" "}
        <code>.env.local</code>: the step runs{" "}
        <code>npx copilotkit@latest project select</code> from the frontend app
        directory and says that command writes the file. Step 1 no longer hands
        out a license key either; it is now a sign-in to cloud-hosted Intelligence,
        and the page never runs <code>copilotkit login</code> before{" "}
        <code>project select</code>. This repo keeps its copy of the key in{" "}
        <code>frontend/.env.local</code>, which Next.js reads alongside{" "}
        <code>.env</code>. The same
        step&apos;s callout documents dropping both options to fall back to SSE
        mode with an in-memory runner — that is what{" "}
        <code>/api/copilotkit</code> here does, so Threads and the Inspector stay
        locked on this route. The Intelligence-wired version lives on{" "}
        <code>/api/copilotkit-threads</code>, used by the{" "}
        <a href="/threads" className="underline">
          Rich Threads
        </a>{" "}
        pages.
      </Callout>

      <Callout tone="info" title="Why runtimeUrl can be relative">
        <code>/api/copilotkit</code> resolves because Next.js serves both the app
        and the runtime from one origin, which is the arrangement the doc&apos;s
        provider callout describes. A client-only frontend would need a
        standalone runtime server and an absolute URL instead.
      </Callout>

      <Callout tone="warn" title="Model id in the docs">
        The Quickstart&apos;s env block sets{" "}
        <code>OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL_ID=gpt-5.4-mini</code> while the Python code
        directly beneath it defaults to <code>gpt-5.4-mini</code>. This repo keeps
        the code&apos;s default and lets <code>OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL_ID</code>{" "}
        override it.
