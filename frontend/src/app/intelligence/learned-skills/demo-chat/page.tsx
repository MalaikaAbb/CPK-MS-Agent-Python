/**
 * Skill delivery, against this repo's quickstart agent.
 *
 * There is no adapter to mount. The page's only Microsoft Agent Framework
 * adapter is `CopilotKit.Intelligence.AgentFramework`, a .NET 9 package, and
 * this section's backend is Python; the base client the page says Python uses,
 * `copilotkit-intelligence-runtime`, is not on PyPI either. So
 * `SkillRegistryContextProvider` cannot be constructed here in any language
 * this repo runs, and the two tools it would register never exist.
 *
 * The 2026-09-21 sync added a second candidate, `BuiltInAgent`, which runs in
 * the TypeScript runtime this app already has. Its snippets failed to compile
 * at `@copilotkit/runtime` 1.69.2 and compile at 1.73.3 (the route page carries
 * both results). It still does not help here: a `BuiltInAgent` is its own
 * TypeScript agent, so mounting it would replace this repo's Python agent
 * rather than deliver skills to it.
 *
 * The demo shows the absence rather than faking the presence: the agent is
 * this repo's normal `my_agent`, and the prompt asks for the exact tool names
 * the page reserves. The agent answers from its own instructions with no tool
 * call, which is what a reader following the page ends up with.
 *
 * The tool names below are quoted from the page's "Read tools" section. They
 * are listed as text, not registered — registering look-alike tools would make
 * the page appear to work and destroy the finding.
