/**
 * `lib/workspaces.ts` from
 * https://docs.copilotkit.ai/ms-agent-python/cookbook/jev-generative-ui,
 * shipped verbatim.
 *
 * The recipe builds this file from two code blocks: step 1 publishes the
 * `candidates` array, then says "add the shape of the UI state to the same
 * file" and publishes the schemas. Both blocks are below, in that order, with
 * nothing between them and nothing changed.
 *
 * This is one of the two published files in the recipe that runs here. It
 * needs zod and nothing else, and it compiles on this repo's zod 4.4.3
 * (declared `^4.4.3`) rather than the `zod@4.6.5` the recipe pins. `readAction`
 * in `./read-action.ts` is the other. Everything that touches Jev, LangChain or
 * AG-UI is quoted on the route page instead, because it cannot run here.
 *
 * One deviation, and it is the location: the recipe puts this at `lib/` with
 * the `@/*` alias pointing at the project root. This repo's alias points at
 * `src/`, and its convention is that a doc page's code lives under that page's
 * route. See FINDINGS.md #21.
