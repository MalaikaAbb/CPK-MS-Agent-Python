            project with the <code>@/*</code> alias, and to place everything
            inside <code>src/</code> if the project uses one, which this repo
            does. Followed literally that puts the recipe&apos;s{" "}
            <code>app/page.tsx</code> over the harness landing page and its{" "}
            <code>app/api/copilotkit/[[...slug]]/route.ts</code> over the
            runtime route every other page in this section shares.{" "}
            <code>basePath: &quot;/api/copilotkit&quot;</code> is hardcoded in
            the snippet and the frontend&apos;s{" "}
            <code>runtimeUrl=&quot;/api/copilotkit&quot;</code> matches it, so
            there is no documented way to mount this recipe beside an existing
            CopilotKit app. The page is written for a fresh project and never
            says so in those words.

            <code>client.systemOne({"{"} model: &quot;jev-1.13.0&quot; {"}"})</code>{" "}
            pins a Jev model in code, with no note on how to find a current one
            and no link to a model list. On the OpenAI side the reverse
            happens: <code>.env.local</code> sets{" "}
            <code>OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.4</code> and the code then reads{" "}
            <code>process.env.OPENAI_MODEL || &quot;gpt-5.4&quot;</code>, so
            the variable can be deleted with no effect. The Quickstart has the
            mirror-image defect in FINDINGS.md #7, where the env block and the
            code disagree.

          <Callout tone="success" title="What did compile, verbatim, at 1.69.2">
            Worth recording as a negative result. The AG-UI adapter, the runtime
            route and the whole published <code>Picker</code> component, all
            typecheck unchanged against the installed 1.69.2 tree, so nothing on
            this page is known to <em>need</em> the 1.73.0 floor the install
            line sets. Only the three absent modules fail, and they fail for
            being absent rather than for being wrong. The probe files were
            deleted after the run.

            <code>/ms-agent-python/cookbook/jev-generative-ui</code> resolves
            200 and is listed in <code>sitemap.xml</code>. The sidebar tree the
            section serves has no Cookbook folder at all: it carries a
            top-level link to <code>/cookbook</code>, outside the section. So
            the page is reachable from the section only by URL, search or
            sitemap.
