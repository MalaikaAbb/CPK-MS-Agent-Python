          <code>useAgent</code> hands you the agent instance directly — its
          messages, shared state, thread id, and whether it is currently running.
          Combined with <code>copilotkit.runAgent()</code> you can drive a
          conversation from a button, a form, or a background trigger with no
          chat UI in the picture.

          <code>copilotkit.runAgent({"{ agent }"})</code> is the orchestrated
          path: it executes frontend tools, handles the follow-up runs those
          tools trigger, and routes errors through the subscriber system.{" "}
          <code>agent.runAgent()</code> is the low-level call — it sends the
          request but does neither, so a browser-executed tool would never fire.

          <code>agentId</code> is passed explicitly on every route in this repo.
          The backend serves four agents, so there is no single implicit
          default to fall back on.
